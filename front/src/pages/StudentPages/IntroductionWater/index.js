            <span className="expCCWater">
            The maintenance of parameters, with well-defined limits, is a fundamental characteristic for the possibility of life. One of the most relevant of these parameters is the control of WATER in the organism of animals, other examples being: Na+, Ca++, Temperature, Hormonal Concentrations, Glucose, etc. <br />The total volume of water of an animal remains relatively constant throughout the day. The (daily, natural) gain and loss of water vary continuously within these limits previously mentioned.
            </span>
            <h1 className="titlesCCWater">Specifying for: </h1>
            <ul className="itemsCCWater">
              <li>
                <strong>GAIN:</strong> The intake of water in liquid form + water present in food + water originating from cellular metabolism.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>LOSS:</strong> It occurs in the form of Urine + Sweating +
                Breathing + Feces + Milk.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <span className="expCCWater">
            Both the gain and loss of water from the animal's body are continuous, with more significant episodes and others less so, for example: when urinating, the animal eliminates a significant amount of water at one time, on the other hand, the loss through breathing is not at one time, instead, it occurs continuously, varying according to several environmental factors. The gain occurs in the same way, with the ingestion of natural water in a significant amount at one time, and the metabolic loss is not so specific.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span className="expCCWater">
            When the loss reaches significant levels, mechanisms for ingestion are triggered, precisely by the sensation of thirst, but other concomitant mechanisms will also be promoted, for example, with the concentration of urine being accentuated, therefore reducing the volume of water eliminated. This situation will be continuous for any animal, with the challenge of DEHYDRATION threatening life permanently.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span className="expCCWater">
            As soon as dehydration begins, the animal will look for water to drink. This varies depending on several aspects, such as: species, physiological state of the individual, age, temperature and humidity of the environment, etc.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Another important point</strong>, related to the loss of water, is the alteration of the electrolytes present in the animal organism, but this topic will be the subject of another activity. The mechanisms related to the control of electrolytes are closely related to the control of water.
