# Quimera-PIC

## console.log("Hello, World!")
Hi! My name is Fernanda Bonfim, and I’m a computer scientist passionate about technology.

This project, Quimera, is all about innovation and creativity. I developed it during my scientific research in 2023. The idea is to gamify and replace animal experiments in the 1st and 2nd-semester Veterinary Medicine classes at Barão de Mauá University.

I’ve provided detailed documentation for this project, which was also included in the scientific article I wrote. You can find it in the folder Quimera/documentation.pdf. Below, I’ll explain how to run the project locally on your machine.

# Installing and Running the API Locally
Commands and Instructions:
1. cd api
2. npm install (If npm is not installed, download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download)
3. npm start
4. API routes can be found in the following files: experimente.route.js, student.route.js and teacher.route.js
If you want to test API endpoints using Postman, you can send requests to these routes. However, the front-end is already integrated and fully functional.
5. The API will run on: http://localhost:3010

# Installing and Running the Front-End Locally
Commands and Instructions:
1. Ensure the API is running in a separate terminal on port 3010.
2. cd front -> npm install
3. npm start You will be redirected to the main screen, http://localhost:3000. Click on "Are you a teacher?
 -> Button (Login)" and log in using the following credentials:
Email: loginForX@gmail.com
Password: XisHere@2025
4. After logging in, follow the documentation to test all the features of the Quimera project.

# Final Notes
I hope you enjoy the project! It was developed in collaboration with experts in veterinary medicine to create a simple and innovative tool for students, aiming to enhance their curiosity and engagement during classes.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions! I also have several other projects that I’ve developed for clients in the Ribeirão Preto/SP region and companies where I’ve worked as a developer.
